<h4>About the Project</h4>
<ul>
<li>A REST API for a CrossFit Training Application</li>
<li>If you're not familiar with CrossFit, it's a fitness method and competitive sport that combines high-intensity workouts with elements from several sports (olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and others).</li>
<li>In the application there're create, read, update and delete WOD's (Workouts of the Day).</li>
<li>This will help our users (that will be gym owners) come up with workout plans and maintain their own workouts inside a single application</li>
</ul>

<h4>Architecture </h4>
<ul>
<li>A Three Layer Architecture using Express.js for the API as shown</li>
